# Heroku Build Issue - FIXED

## Problem Solved
The Heroku build was failing because Vite couldn't find `client/index.html`. This has been fixed by updating the build configuration.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- Added `root: "./client"` to specify the correct entry point
- Added `build.outDir: "../dist/public"` for proper output directory
- Fixed the build path resolution

### 2. Server Static File Serving (`server/index.ts`)
- Updated production static file serving
- Added proper path resolution for built assets
- Configured SPA fallback for React routes

### 3. Package Configuration
- Confirmed Node.js 18.x engine specification
- Verified all dependencies are correct
- Build command remains: `vite build && esbuild server/index.ts...`

## New Package Ready
**Download: `music-explorer-build-fixed.tar.gz`**

## Deployment Steps

1. **Upload to GitHub** - All files with build fixes
2. **Create Heroku App** and connect repository
3. **Set Config Vars**:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://jjjust777:onetwothree@mycluster.zgyuybq.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=MyCluster
   LASTFM_API_KEY=your_actual_key
   VITE_LASTFM_API_KEY=your_actual_key
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
4. **Deploy** - Build should succeed now

## What the Build Does
1. `vite build` - Compiles React frontend to `dist/public/`
2. `esbuild server/index.ts` - Bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. `npm start` - Runs production server with static file serving

Your MERN stack application will now deploy successfully to Heroku with a functional live API for lecturer testing.
