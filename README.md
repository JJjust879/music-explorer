# Music Explorer API - Fixed Deployment

## Issue Fixed
The build was failing because the deployment was looking for Vite, but this is a pure Node.js API that doesn't need any build step.

## Updated Files for GitHub

### package.json (simplified)
```json
{
  "name": "music-explorer-api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.21.2",
    "cors": "^2.8.5", 
    "mongodb": "^6.17.0",
    "axios": "^1.10.0"
  }
}
```

### Deployment Settings
- **Build Command**: Leave EMPTY (no build needed)
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Node Version**: 18.x

## Environment Variables
Set these in your deployment platform:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
LASTFM_API_KEY=your_lastfm_api_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Files to Upload to GitHub
1. `index.js` (complete API with DELETE endpoint)
2. `package.json` (simplified, no build tools)
3. `music-app-github.html` (frontend)
4. `.env.example` 
5. `README.md`

## No Build Step Required
