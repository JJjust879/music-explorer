# Music Explorer - Video Demo Checklist

## üé• **Pre-Recording Setup**

### Technical Preparation
- [ ] Clear browser cache and refresh application
- [ ] Ensure stable internet connection for API calls
- [ ] Test Last.fm and Deezer API responses
- [ ] Verify MongoDB connection is working
- [ ] Check audio preview functionality
- [ ] Close unnecessary browser tabs and applications

### Screen Recording Setup
- [ ] Set screen resolution to 1920x1080 for best quality
- [ ] Use screen recording software (OBS, Loom, or QuickTime)
- [ ] Test audio recording if providing narration
- [ ] Ensure clean desktop background
- [ ] Close notification banners and popups

## üó£Ô∏è **Key Points to Emphasize**

### MERN Stack Components
- [ ] **MongoDB**: "Real-time data persistence with cloud database"
- [ ] **Express**: "RESTful API with proper HTTP methods"
- [ ] **React**: "Modern frontend with TypeScript and hooks"
- [ ] **Node.js**: "Backend server with external API integration"

### Technical Features
- [ ] **Database CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete playlists
- [ ] **API Integration**: Live data from Last.fm and Deezer
- [ ] **Authentication**: User session management
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful API failure management
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop compatibility

### Professional Aspects
- [ ] **Code Quality**: TypeScript, proper structure, clean architecture
- [ ] **UI/UX**: Spotify-inspired design, intuitive navigation
- [ ] **Performance**: Fast loading, optimized API calls
- [ ] **Deployment**: Production-ready configuration

## üé¨ **Demo Flow Sequence**

### 1. Application Overview (Show Homepage)
- [ ] Point out navigation structure
- [ ] Highlight responsive design
- [ ] Show loading states for API calls

### 2. Music Discovery
- [ ] Browse top charts from different countries
- [ ] Demonstrate genre filtering
- [ ] Show artist and track information

### 3. Search Functionality
- [ ] Search for popular artist (e.g., "Taylor Swift")
- [ ] Show real-time search results
- [ ] Display track metadata and artwork

### 4. Audio Playback
- [ ] Click on a track to start preview
- [ ] Show audio player controls
- [ ] Demonstrate volume and seeking

### 5. Playlist Management (CRUD Demo)
- [ ] **Create**: Add new playlist with name and description
- [ ] **Read**: Show all playlists in library
- [ ] **Update**: Add tracks to playlist, edit details
- [ ] **Delete**: Remove tracks and delete playlist

### 6. Database Persistence
- [ ] Refresh page to show data persistence
- [ ] Navigate between pages to verify state

### 7. Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Toggle browser responsive mode
- [ ] Show mobile navigation and layout

## üö® **Potential Issues & Solutions**

### API Problems
- [ ] **Last.fm slow response**: Have backup screenshots ready
- [ ] **Deezer preview unavailable**: Explain this is normal for some tracks
- [ ] **Rate limiting**: Use cached data or explain API limitations

### Technical Issues
- [ ] **Database connection**: Restart application if needed
- [ ] **Audio not playing**: Check browser audio permissions
- [ ] **Slow loading**: Mention this is due to free-tier hosting
